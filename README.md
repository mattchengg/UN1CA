# What is UN1CA?
UN1CA is a work-in-progress custom firmware for Samsung Galaxy devices, designed to provide a refined, optimized and more rich One UI experience.
It is based on the latest and greatest iteration of Samsung's UX and it integrates numerous improvements, optimizations and exclusive features.
